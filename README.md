# Private Mobile Input and Interaction Using LipReading
In this design, I have integrated six vibration motors on the back of the phone. Each vibration motor is equipped with a built-in resistor, diode, and transistor for its operation. The motors are arranged with one at each corner of the phone and two in the middle section. The prototype is being tested on a Moto G Power 2023 smartphone. The motors are controlled using an Arduino Nano ESP32 board, which is programmed via a wired connection to my laptop. The Arduino board is powered by an external 4xAA battery pack. Additionally, a potentiometer is included in the circuit to regulate the voltage supplied to the motors, enabling control over the intensity of the vibrations.
